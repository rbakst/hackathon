In order to provide services in the most efficient manner, health clinics would like to hire the right number of doctors to minimize
wait-time for patients. This program allows health care providers to enter the percentage of appointments whose lengths fall within 
each 15-minute range, up to one hour. By simulating a waiting room in which patients arrive throughout the workday and enter the office
for the duration of their appointments, this program calculates wait times for the dayâ€™s patients, on average. Using the simulated information, the 
clinic can decide if they should adjust the number of doctors they hire.
